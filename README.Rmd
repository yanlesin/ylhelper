# ylhelper

The goal of ylhelper is to provide warpper functions for frequently used combination of openxlsx functions in my R coding. Some examples include writing dataframe into excel with auto width or with numeric or other formats for certain columns.
There is a lot of "first" with this package for me: first R package, first public repo, and so on - please, consider this as an experiment.

## Installation

You can install the development version of ylhelper from [GitHub](https://github.com/yanlesin/ylhelper) with:

``` r
library(devtools)
install_github("yanlesin/ylhelper")
```
